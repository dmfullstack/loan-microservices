### Uses
- spring-boot/cloud
- H2 DB - schema generated by spring-jpa (hibernate) at startup, it will store data in home directory ~/h2/loandb
- swagger generated UI for convenience

### Modules
- eureka-server - plain Eureka server where microservices will register themselves for use
- loan-service - "loan" REST resource methods (http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html)
- loan-repository - REST services for persistence of loan application and its related entities (via repository pattern) (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### Run
Open each module and execute run.sh

Alternative is to start run.sh located in root of git repository which is going to start all 3 modules in background.  
You might need to find and kill processes once finished.

If you want db file to be stored in some other directory (by default it's ~/h2)  
Adjust `/loan-repository/src/main/resources/application.properties`  
`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:~/h2/loandb`
